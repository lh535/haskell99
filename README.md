trying to solve the 99 (in reality 88) problems from this [Haskell Wiki site](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems).  


I'm viewing the solutions after doing each problem, because they often contain interesting approaches  
or more techniques I could learn from. There is a comment at the end of each file which documents interesting  
solutions directly from the site, sometimes with notes.
